# Writing Scaffold

I have built this scaffold to help me gather, store content on writing effectively, correctly and creatively. To help me grow as a writer. I have taken up [Goins's 500 words challenge](http://goinswriter.com/my500words/), starting from October 11, 2015. I am documenting my progress [here](https://github.com/suriyadeepan/500words). I have also signed up for [NanoWrimo](http://nanowrimo.org/), an one month novel writing challenge starting Nov 1.

There are quite a few problems that I encounter while writing. I need to concentrate on my grammar, punctuation, phrasing and scene building. In this repository, I am putting up the resources necessary for me to continue my progress as a writer, without plateauing.
